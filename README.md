# The-heroes-game
Create a Hero class (name and HP points). Create three different classes, extending from the Hero. They should contain:  information whether a hero of this class can fly, information whether a hero of this class has a shield, an attack method, with some HP of damage (it is different for different classes). Create a Fight class, which will emulate a fight of two heroes. One attacks the another until one of them loses all HP. Additionally:  if the hero attacked can fly, he has a 50% chance of avoiding damage, if the hero attacked has a shield, the inflicted damage is reduced by 20%. by SDA
